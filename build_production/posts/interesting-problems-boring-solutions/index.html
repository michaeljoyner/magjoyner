                <h3 class="font-sans text-sm">A bit of backstory</h3>

<p>Like countless other web-devs out there, I started off just trying to make a website. Each time I came across a problem I turned to Google, and like so many before me who started out without much pre-existing knowledge, I ended up with the little family of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Over the following months and years I would learn more of each, until the point where I was confident enough with each to start taking on jobs for others.</p>

<p>Of the bunch, I found PHP to be the most interesting, and empowering. Discovering and learning Laravel only amplified that. Javascript was nice and all, but front-end development was not the exciting space it is today. So I poured more energy into PHP development, brushing aside all the snide PHP remarks, and I don't regret a minute of it.</p>

<p>Then I started to notice something. I seemed to be enjoying Javascript much more, especially since the advent of ES6 (or whatever it is called). I would be excited when I knew I had a decent amount of Javascript to write, and that excitement wasn't there with the PHP anymore. I found myself writing little Node.js apps just to see what the fuss was about. More recently, I have started to learn Go, and now I just want to write Go.</p>

<h3 class="font-sans text-sm">So what about good ol' PHP?</h3>

<p>Does this all mean I am going to ditch PHP? No, and here is why. Once I started writing a web app in either Node or Go, the thought of taking care of all those essential, yet mundane, parts like sessions and authentication is just tiring. In Laravel app, that would be a few minutes setup and soon I'd be into the actual app-specific part, which is always the most interesting. I understand that in any other language there are also frameworks and libraries that can make it just as quick, but then I'd be learning new libraries and such, not so much learning and using these new languages I find so exciting.</p>

<p>So, if someone is paying me for my time, and it's a web app they want, Laravel is still the one for me (with a good dose of Vue if possible, just for good measure).</p>

<p>However, if I am building a side-project, or just making something for myself, I will do it all in whatever language I currently find most interesting and fitting. And one day, hopefully, I'll be so comfortable with it that I could consider it as a "boring" soltion.</p>

<h3 class="font-sans text-sm">Finally, my point</h3>

<p>For web apps that require a back-end, I consider Laravel/PHP my boring approach. I know what works and what doesn't, which approach best suits which occasion and so on. I don't get too excited about any of the language features, and most of the language problems of PHP have been abstacted over. So if I have an interesting problem which can be solved by this approach, I can be fairly confident I will eventually be left with a product I can be proud of, and isn't that why we started this in the first place?</p>

<p>For the interesting approaches, in my case Node and Go at the moment, I will continue to use them, but only for "boring" problems, or for things that don't really matter. The goal is for them to eventually become the "boring" solution, so I can tackle more interesting problems.</p>
